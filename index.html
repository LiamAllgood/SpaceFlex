                    Welcome to SpaceFlex, where we sort of care about space exploration. Sure, SpaceX might be out there landing rockets on barges like they’re throwing darts at a pub, but we prefer a more laid-back approach. Who needs reusable rockets when you can probably build new ones? We might not be sending cars into orbit (because we actually use ours to drive), but we’ll get there—eventually. While others are busy colonizing Mars, we’re perfectly happy exploring the upper atmosphere... or at least close to it. At SpaceFlex, we believe in slow, steady, and totally deliberate progress. After all, space isn’t going anywhere, and neither are we—yet.

                    At SpaceFlex, we pride ourselves on our "achievements" that redefine the term underwhelming. While others launch rockets and explore distant planets, we've managed to send a paper airplane to the upper atmosphere—only to discover it was just a fancy kite. Our crowning glory? Successfully launching a marshmallow into low Earth orbit (a.k.a. the backyard). We may not be winning any space races, but we’re experts at offering coffee breaks during rocket launches and organizing weekly “space walks” that mostly involve wandering around the office. At SpaceFlex, we believe that every small step counts, even if it’s more of a leisurely stroll than a giant leap for mankind!

                <h3>SpaceFlex Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to SpaceFlex – the future of space exploration (if you trust us, that is). By using our services, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which may or may not make sense.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>No Refunds, No Regrets. Once you book your ticket to space, all sales are final. Whether you make it to orbit, get stuck in a low-Earth traffic jam, or simply watch your rocket become an elaborate firework, you’re in for the ride of your life (or lack thereof). Refunds? Never heard of them.</li>
                    <li>Survival Not Guaranteed. SpaceFlex is committed to pushing the boundaries of space travel, mostly by trial and error. Should anything go wrong (and it likely will), please remain calm. Your screams will only waste oxygen. SpaceFlex takes no responsibility for any loss of life, limb, or sanity.</li>
                    <li>Zero Gravity, Zero Accountability. In space, no one can hear you complain. By using our services, you agree to hold SpaceFlex harmless for any and all injuries, malfunctions, or "unexpected outcomes" that may occur during your trip. This includes, but is not limited to, unplanned exits from the spacecraft and spontaneous combustion.</li>
                    <li>Your Data, Our Treasure. By visiting SpaceFlex.com, you agree that all your personal data, browsing history, and poorly chosen passwords are now our property. We may or may not sell it to the highest bidder, but we assure you, they’ll probably be nice about it.</li>
                    <li> Terms Subject to Change. These terms may change without notice, and by "change," we mean "get worse." Check back often, but don’t expect clarity.</li>
                    <li>Final Word. By clicking "I Agree," you confirm that you’ve read and understood these terms (or at least pretended to). Welcome aboard SpaceFlex, where the sky is not the limit—but maybe it should be.</li>
